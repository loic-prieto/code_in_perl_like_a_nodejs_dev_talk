            Talk about async programming:
            - The paradigm: the bottleneck is not the code, but io.

            - ideal cases: event driven applications

            - A browser

            - an server that waits for requests

            - Explain the paradigm

sub do_something_async {
  my ($param,$callback_sub) = @_;

  # Do something that takes some time 
  # on a thread.
  # [...]
  # on work done call $callback_sub();

  # We return *before* the work has been done

          <aside class="notes">
            This is just the style.

            The code is not correct, it is still synchronous. This is more of
            a perlish pseudo code.

            For the previous example, there was no benefit whatsoever because
            it was a linear simple script. Nothing is gained by going async.

            The next example will show how even in a simple script we can start
            to gain some benefits by using async to perform more work in the same
            amount of time.

          <aside class="notes">
            This is the traditional way to fetch website content. 

            This script will scale on time execution linearly with each url.	

            This is the perfect use case of asynchronous programming, because the io is what is
            taking most of the time, not the code.

            The execution time is now roughly the slowest fetch from all of the urls to be fetched
            since the contents are fetched in parallel.

            This is the simplest example I could come with. But async programming really shines for
            server scenarios, where we want to perform more work while waiting for other jobs to finish

            I've been lying.

            The code as it is, won't work. In NodeJS and if it was written in javascript it would work,
            but there's a missing piece in perl. We're going back to the previous slide to see it.

            Show that the results of the fetching will never be shown, because the script will have ended
            by the time they come.

            Why would this work in nodejs but not on perl?

            We would need something to wait while the contents of the urls are fetched and that would execute
            the callback code when the contents are fetched...that something is called an Event Loop.
